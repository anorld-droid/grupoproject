## Architecture

The architecture comprises three main components: Firebase for backend services, Algolia Search API for search functionality, and FlutterFlow for frontend design and development. These components work together to create a seamless and feature-rich application.

Firebase provides a comprehensive suite of backend services that simplify the app development.

Algolia API provides powerful search and sort capabilities that enhance user experience and enable efficient data retrieval.
